* Project Vision *
Produce a web application that allows users to interactively plan their CSE degrees based on degree/course constraints and to also allow users to contribute to publicly viewable course reviews/evaluations.

** Degree Planner **
Interaction with the user begins by getting them to choose from a list of degrees/programs offered by CSE. Upon making a selection, a list is produced which contains all the mandatory courses that are required to complete the degree, where each course is allocated in a degree time slot (e.g. Semester 2, Year 2). Where there are gaps between the mandatory courses, a user can fill them in from a list that would be appropriate to the time slot and pre-requisite constraints.

**  Course Reviewer **
Each course offered by UNSW will be listed on the web application and have itâ€™s own review page which consists of aggregated ratings (e.g. fun factor, challenge factor, etc.) and more detailed reviews all submitted by users. I.e. A user can select a course and submit a review that will be aggregated onto the course review page and contribute to the aid of students deciding on what courses they would like to study.
